Day 1: Setup JMS Connection and Implement Producer-Consumer

Setup Apache ActiveMQ Artemis or another JMS broker of your choice on your local environment.
Create a JMS connection factory and destination (queue or topic) in your JMS provider.
Implement a JMS producer application that sends messages to the destination.
Implement a JMS consumer application that receives and processes messages from the destination.
Test the end-to-end functionality of your JMS setup by sending and consuming messages between the producer and consumer.

Day 2: Implement Request-Response Pattern

Explore the request-response messaging pattern in JMS and its use cases in distributed systems.
Design a request-response messaging protocol with a designated reply destination for responses.
Implement a JMS requestor application that sends requests to a destination and waits for responses on the reply destination.
Implement a JMS responder application that listens for requests, processes them, and sends responses back to the reply destination.
Test the request-response functionality by sending requests from the requestor and receiving responses from the responder.

Day 3: Implement Message Filtering

Explore message filtering techniques in JMS, such as message selectors or JMS headers.
Implement message filtering in your JMS consumer to selectively process messages based on criteria like message properties or content.
Experiment with different filtering strategies to optimize message processing efficiency.


Day 4: Implement Message Transformation

Learn about message transformation techniques in JMS, such as message translators or message converters.
Implement message transformation logic in your JMS producer or consumer to convert message formats or structures as needed.
Experiment with different transformation strategies to handle diverse data formats or integrate with external systems.


Day 5: Explore JMS Transactions

Dive into JMS transactional messaging and its role in ensuring message delivery reliability and data consistency.
Implement transactional messaging in your JMS producer and consumer to handle message acknowledgments and transaction boundaries.
Experiment with different transactional scenarios, such as local vs. distributed transactions, to understand their implications on message processing.


Day 6: Investigate Message Persistence

Explore message persistence options in JMS providers, such as file-based, database-based, or in-memory message stores.
Configure message persistence settings in your JMS broker and observe how it affects message durability and recovery in case of failures.
Experiment with different persistence configurations to optimize performance and reliability based on your application requirements.


Day 7: Handle Message Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Learn about the concept of a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in JMS and its role in handling undeliverable or expired messages.
Configure a DLQ in your JMS broker and set up message redelivery policies to route problematic messages to the DLQ.
Implement DLQ monitoring and recovery mechanisms in your JMS consumer to handle messages in the DLQ appropriately.


Day 8: Implement Message Retry Mechanism

Explore message retry strategies in JMS, such as exponential backoff, fixed delay, or circuit breaker patterns.
Implement a message retry mechanism in your JMS consumer to handle transient failures or temporary network issues gracefully.
Experiment with different retry configurations and observe their impact on message delivery reliability and system performance.


Day 9: Explore JMS Security Features

Dive into JMS security features, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and message integrity.
Configure security settings in your JMS broker and client applications to enforce secure communication channels and access controls.
Experiment with different security mechanisms to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your messaging system.


Day 10: Performance Tuning and Optimization

Explore performance tuning techniques for JMS applications, such as connection pooling, prefetching, and message batching.
Analyze performance metrics and bottlenecks in your JMS application using profiling tools or monitoring solutions.
Optimize your JMS configuration and codebase to improve message throughput, latency, and scalability for enterprise-scale deployments.
